He closes his eyes, and with the power of his mind alone, he can visualize the exact location of a nuclear sub hidden in the ocean thousands of miles away. Can a human being possess such ability?","content":["During the Cold War, the US government received a classified report saying that the KGB and the Soviet military had been pouring money into parapsychological research, such as ESP, remote viewing, and psychokinesis. Such programs started as far back as the 1920s, and Soviet scientists had already perfected their application for espionage purposes.","Fear of missing out prompted the U.S. Army and the CIA to set up their own psychic research programs immediately. The American public was left in the dark until the CIA declassified this information decades later. One of these reports is called the Gateway Process—a training system designed to help you transcend the limit of spacetime by using … wait for it … meditation. Superpowers! How?","The basis of “Gateway Experience” comes from research conducted by Robert Monroe, a radio broadcasting executive whose book popularized the term “out-of-body experience.” To understand Monroe’s technique, we first need to understand brainwaves. The brain is an electrochemical organ. Brainwaves are oscillating electrical voltages in the brain, measuring just a few millionths of a volt. These oscillations are the product of billions of neurons communicating with each other through electrical currents. When humans are wide awake, the brain functions at a beta frequency, and when they are asleep, the brain functions at the theta frequency."],"citations":[{"text":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00315/full","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00315/full"},{"text":"https://hbr.org/2015/01/mindfulness-can-literally-change-your-brain","url":"https://hbr.org/2015/01/mindfulness-can-literally-change-your-brain"},{"text":"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients","url":"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
